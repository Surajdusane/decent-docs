# 📦 What is a Package Manager?

A **package manager** is like a browser, but instead of visiting websites, it installs all the required files and tools on your computer to help you build software—especially useful for **full stack development**.

It handles downloading, installing, updating, and managing dependencies (libraries and tools) your project needs.
