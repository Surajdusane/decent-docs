Welcome! If youâ€™ve ever paused a 30-minute YouTube tutorial just to figure out if the video is even solving your problem... you're in the right place.
This documentation was built for **developers like you** â€” full-stack builders, indie hackers, and learners who want real solutions _without wasting time_.


## ðŸš€ Why I Built This

I was tired of bouncing between official docs, long videos, and forums just to solve one bug. I'd spend hours watching tutorials that didnâ€™t deliver, only to find the right answer hidden at minute 19 in a random comment.

So I built this: a fast, focused place where you can search coding topics and get **high-quality YouTube tutorials with timestamped solutions** â€” no fluff, just answers.

import {
	Hourglass,
	PanelTopDashed,
	Search,
	StepForward,
	Code,
} from 'lucide-react';

## âœ¨ Key Features
