## why choose react js insted of next js

React is great. It's flexible, powerful, and super popular. But sometimes you need a bit more structure and built-in features to move faster and avoid setup headaches. That’s where **Next.js** comes in.

import YouTubePreview from '@/components/mdx/youtube-preview';

<YouTubePreview youtubeUrl='https://youtu.be/Zq5fmkH0T78?si=FkAVanAPniDZBkZR' startTime='06:22' endTime='10:13' />

## Advantages of Next.js

## 1. 📁 Easy Page Routing

With React, you need to install and set up `react-router` to manage your routes. In Next.js, you just create a file inside the `pages/` folder, and that automatically becomes a route.

**Example:**

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

<Files>
  <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
  <Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
    <File name="page.tsx" />
  </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

- `about/page.js` → `yourapp.com/about`

This makes routing simple and keeps your project organized from the start.

## 2. ⚡ Better Performance with SSR & SSG

Next.js supports **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)** out of the box.

This means:
- Your pages load faster
- Content shows up sooner for users
- Search engines can read your pages better (improved SEO)

React only does client-side rendering by default, so you’d need extra tools to get the same result.

## 3. 🔧 Built-in API Routes

Need a small backend or want to connect to a database? Next.js lets you create **API routes** directly inside your app. Just create a file in the `pages/api/` folder, and it becomes an endpoint.

**Example:**
- `pages/api/hello.js` → `yourapp.com/api/hello`

This is perfect for small backend tasks without needing a separate server like Express.

## 4. ✅ Production-Ready Features

Next.js gives you a lot of features out of the box:
- Image optimization
- Automatic code splitting
- Fast refresh in development
- Easy deployment with Vercel

With React alone, you’d need to add and configure these features manually.
